# SaaS-Valuation-Tool

Project Overview: This project aims to provide investors with insights into the public SaaS (Software as a Service) landscape, helping them to better evaluate and forecast the value of new and upcoming private SaaS firms. By analyzing trends in public SaaS companies, this tool leverages corporate valuation principles—most notably the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model—to make more accurate predictions about the future cash flows of SaaS companies.

Key Goals:
Public SaaS Company Insights: Provide investors with a detailed overview of how large public SaaS companies are performing across several key metrics. The data is visualized through a Tableau dashboard, which offers an intuitive way to track these trends and support investment decisions in new and emerging private SaaS firms.
Forecasting Future Cash Flows: Equip investors with a machine learning tool that forecasts unlevered free cash flows (UFCF) for private SaaS firms. These forecasts are based on models trained using data from over 170 public SaaS companies, removing some of the guesswork from traditional financial models.
Project Features:
Data Collection: Using Python, I built web scrapers to pull data from APIs like Yahoo Finance (yfinance) and EODHD Financial API. The data collected includes financial statements, cash flow trends, and various valuation metrics.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I utilized NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib to analyze and clean the data, producing over 15 visualizations. This analysis provides insights into the financial health and performance of these companies.
Machine Learning Models: I developed and trained deep learning models (using TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn) to predict unlevered free cash flows (UFCF). These models are designed to assist investors in applying the DCF framework more effectively.
How to Read and Understand this Project in Order: (each notebook also has markdown text to help explain my processes and coding procedures)
Look Through Data Collection in this order:

Valuation Metrics: Raw financial and company data sourced from APIs.
Exploratory Analysis: Visualizations and initial insights.
Partial-DCF ML Model Processing: Preprocessing steps for training the DCF forecasting models.
